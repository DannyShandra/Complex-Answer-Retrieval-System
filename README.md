# Complex-Answer-Retrieval-System
While current retrieval systems provide good results for phrase-level retrieval of simple facts, they are less effective in assembling facts into an information package. This project will focus on answering more complex information needs with longer answers through assembling of different information sources. Much like Wikipedia pages that synthesize knowledge that is globally distributed, I am interested in building a retrieval system that collects relevant information from an entire corpus, creating synthetically structured documents by collating retrieved results. I attempt to assemble an information package or the so called complex answer in response to an information need in question answering systems.
